# Numpy vs Python for Matrix Multiplication
The code in this repository demonstrates that Numpy is way fater than Nowmal Python for mathematical computation (especially Matrix Multiplication)
## Running the code produces the following graph
This graph is a comparision between time taken by Numpy and Nowmal Python code in multiplying 2 matrices. X axis shows Value of n (no. of rows and colums of a randomly generated matrix) whereas the Y axis shows time taken in seconds.
