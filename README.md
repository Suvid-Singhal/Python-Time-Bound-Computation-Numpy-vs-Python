# Numpy vs Python for Matrix Multiplication
The code in this repository demonstrates that Numpy is way fater than Nowmal Python for mathematical computation (especially Matrix Multiplication)
## Running the code produces the following graph
This graph is a comparision between time taken by Numpy and Nowmal Python code in multiplying 2 matrices. X axis shows Value of n (no. of rows and colums of a randomly generated matrix) whereas the Y axis shows time taken in seconds.

## Instructions to Run
Run the following commands in order to run the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suvid-Singhal/Python-Time-Bound-Computation-Numpy-vs-Python.git

cd Python-Time-Bound-Computation-Numpy-vs-Python

python3 run.py
```

## Conclusion

After seeing the result, we can conclude that Numpy is way faster than Normal Python for complex mathematical calculations. But let us now see why Numpy is faster than Normal Python.
